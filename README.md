# YMDE (YouTube Music Downloader and Exporter)

This container:
- Scans your Google Takeout JSON playlists (from YouTube/YouTube Music).
- Also converts CSV playlists to the same JSON format.
- Downloads audio for each track using `yt-dlp`.
- Organizes and tags files for media servers like Jellyfin.
- Saves files to `library/Artist/Album/Title.ext`.
- Optionally writes `.m3u8` playlists to `library/_playlists/`.

Note: Use this tool only in ways permitted by YouTubeâ€™s Terms of Service and your local laws.

## Quick Start

1.  **Prerequisites**: Docker and Docker Compose must be installed.

2.  **Setup Folders**: Create `data` and `library` directories next to your `compose.yml` file.

    ```bash
    mkdir -p data library
    ```

    - Place your Takeout JSON and/or CSV files in `./data`.
    - If needed for private or age-gated content, save your browser cookies as `./data/cookies.txt` (Netscape format).

3.  **Build the Image**:

    ```bash
    docker compose build
    ```

4.  **Run the Downloader**:

    ```bash
    docker compose run --rm ymde
    ```

5.  **Check the Results**:
    - Your audio files will be in `./library`.
    - Playlists, if enabled, will be in `./library/_playlists/*.m3u8`.

## Configuration

Edit `compose.yml` to change the default settings via environment variables:

- `AUDIO_FORMAT`: `m4a` (default) or `mp3`.
- `QUALITY`: For `mp3`, this is the VBR quality from `0` (best) to `9` (worst). Default is `0`.
- `CONCURRENCY`: Number of parallel downloads (e.g., `4`).
- `WRITE_M3U`: `1` to create M3U8 playlists from the downloaded folder structure (one per album).
- `REMOVE_VIDEOS_SUFFIX`: `1` (default) to automatically remove the `-videos` suffix from playlist names (e.g., `My Playlist-videos` becomes `My Playlist`). Set to `0` to disable.
- `PREFER_YOUTUBE_MUSIC`: `1` to rewrite YouTube video URLs to `music.youtube.com` for better metadata.
- `VERBOSE`: `0` (default) to show a progress bar, or `1` to show detailed real-time output from `yt-dlp`.
- `RATE_LIMIT`: Download speed limit, e.g., `1M`. To prevent IP bans, this is automatically set to `500K` if you are not using cookies. You can set it to `""` to disable the limit or choose your own value.
- `SLEEP`: A fixed or random delay between downloads, e.g., `5` or `2,8` (for 2-8 seconds).
- `DRY_RUN`: `1` to simulate the process without downloading files.
- `COOKIES`: Path to a cookies file inside the container (default: `/data/cookies.txt`).


## Alternative: `docker run` (without Compose)

```bash
docker build -t ymde .
docker run --rm \
  -v "$PWD/data:/data" \
  -v "$PWD/library:/library" \
  -e AUDIO_FORMAT=m4a \
  -e QUALITY=0 \
  -e CONCURRENCY=2 \
  -e WRITE_M3U=1 \
  -e PREFER_YOUTUBE_MUSIC=1 \
  -e SLEEP="1,3" \
  -e COOKIES=/data/cookies.txt \
  ymde
```

## Tips

- **Folder Structure**: The downloader saves files in an `Artist/Album` structure. This is highly recommended for media servers like Jellyfin, as it helps them correctly identify and organize your music library.
- **Cookies**: Install `cookies.txt` only if needed for age-gated/region/private content.
- **Metadata**: If `yt-dlp` occasionally picks the wrong version of a song, you can edit the URL in your source JSON file and re-run the downloader.
